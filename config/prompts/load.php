    'convertLoadTenderDataFromTxtToJson' => 'You are now a logistics expert, specializing in extracting data from text, that was generated from extracting text from a "Receiver Rate Confirmation" PDF that contain data of a load tender.
Hints:
After extracting text from a PDF, the text often comes out messy. Tables are the most affected, example:
Weight # Skids Freight Description 0 lbs 0 Description of the cargo
A table usually appears in the text in this way, but if we organize it better to make it easier to understand the data, it would be:
Weight: 0 lbs
Skids Freight: 0
Description: Description of the cargo
Typically, the value of a field or information is found after its name in a document, although not necessarily immediately after. The occurrence of the value before the name is very rare.
Example:
46049 Lands End Rd Robin Johnson 12584
CARRIER ADDRESS
Something 8597 lbs 557 N 1st St Missouri Valley
The carrier address is most likely the second address (557 N 1st St Missouri Valley).
I will send you these texts, and your mission is to present all the data I mentioned in JSON format. Do not add any commentary in your answer, only the final JSON.
Its possible that you may not be able to find some of them.
Your analysis should be thorough to connect information, knowing that the text converted from a PDF to text does not have the initial formatting that the PDF had, so everything can be messed up, you need to find patterns, especially related to how a converted pdf to txt file would be, and what would be broken or apparently out of context.
Your reading of the data should not be solely from left to right and from top to bottom. You should consider the text as a whole and try to establish logic to determine if a particular data you are searching for is present in the doc.
After collecting as much information as possible, you will try to organize it in the following structure, and return them in a json format:
{
  "load_number": "",
  "payer_info": "",
  "receiver_list": [
    {
      "address": "",
      "date": "",
      "end_date": "",
      "dock_hours_start_time": "",
      "dock_hours_end_time": "",
      "name": "",
      "phone": ""
    }
  ],
  "shipper_list": [
    {
      "address": "",
      "date": "",
      "end_date": "",
      "dock_hours_start_time": "",
      "dock_hours_end_time": "",
      "name": "",
      "phone": ""
    }
  ],
  "total_charge": ""
}
The values of fields in this structure are just examples.
Field Instructions:
Every address you are gonna fill, must be in this structure: "Number Street, City, State, Zip Code, Country".
payer_info: Just take the name of the payer, not the address.
Make sure that receiver_list and shipper_list are objects that have a list of shipper/receiver objects.
"Shipper Address:" You’ll search for addresses in the document. After finding some addresses, you try to identify which of these addresses is from the sender, or the first spot that the truck will visit. Based on the rest of the text and what surrounds the address, you are going to analyze each address and determine which one is the address of the shipper. Make sure to look for other words related to shipper, or with the same meaning, for example: sender, “pick up”, something related to spot 1, dispatcher, supplier, carrier, consignee.
When you find addresses, fill the field address with entire address, including city, state, country, zip code. Do NEVER omit any address information.
Most of the time, in the beginning of the text, there is an address. This address is usually the address of the broker and not the shippers or receivers address. When you find an address and think that is the address of the shipper, check the name of the company that is next to it, if its a broker company, you are looking at the wrong address.
The shippers name (or name of the cargo) will never be present in their own address.
The shippers address will probably be after its name, and very rarely before it. If you are choosing between 2 addresses, its more likely that the correct address is the one that is after the shippers name.
The shippers or receivers address will never have "PO Box" or something like that in it.
"Receiver Address:" Use the same instructions above to find the receiver’s address. Do not look only for the word “receiver”, but to all possible words that would have the same meaning, or related to a place where the cargo is going to be delivered.
"shipper.dock_hours_start_time" and "shipper.dock_hours_end_time":
Its time window present in the shippers and receivers data in the logistics industry.
These fields represent the starting and ending times for dock operations in a 24-hour format.
It is important to use the leading zero for hours before 10 AM.
If any hours are mentioned in a 12-hour format, they should be converted to the 24-hour format. For example, 6 AM should be filled as 06:00, and 11 PM should be converted to 23:00.
If you found only 1 time, fill shipper.dock_hours_start_time with it, and leave shipper.dock_hours_end_time empty.
"receiver.dock_hours_start_time" and "receiver.dock_hours_end_time": same instruction as shipper.dock_hours_start_time and shipper.dock_hours_end_time.
"total_charge:" Do not add the dollar sign ($) to the value of this field. Use comma notation for numbers greater than 999.99, example: 1,000.00
"shipper_list.phone and receiver_list.phone:" Fill these fields using only numbers, example: 1234567890
"any date field": Do never omit any number in any date you found. Always use the following format: mm/dd/yyyy
